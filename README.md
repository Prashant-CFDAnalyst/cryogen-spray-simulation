# Cryospray CFD Simulation using Eulerian-Lagrangian Model

This project presents a numerical study of cryogen spray behavior using an Eulerian–Lagrangian CFD approach. The simulation captures the phase-change processes, spray dispersion, and the resulting necrosis zone formation during dermatological cryotherapy.

## 🔬 Overview

Cryospray is a minimally invasive method used in dermatology and oncology to ablate superficial lesions by spraying a cryogen (e.g., liquid nitrogen) on the skin. The spray undergoes flashing and droplet breakup, leading to rapid heat extraction from tissue.

This study aims to:
- Simulate multiphase flow of cryogen from nozzle to tissue surface.
- Model flashing-induced atomization.
- Quantify the necrotic zone under varying spray distances.
- Validate CFD results with experimental data.
